Installation
============

In order to allow the file itself to remain in the repositoy, but have the functionality of the command system-wide, I opted to symbolically link the file to /usr/bin. There are other options here, but I'll describe this approach.

First, ensure the file is executable:

	chmod +x lines.sh

Next, create a symbolic link between this file and /usr/bin/lines (or whatever name you chose). I use the full path below due to issues encountered when using relative paths:

	sudo ln -s <full path to directory containining lines.sh>/lines.sh /usr/bin/lines
	
	e.g. sudo ln -s /Users/Walter/GitHub\ Projects/lines/lines.sh /usr/bin/lines
	
And that's it! Typing "lines [directory]" in your shell should now return the number of lines of text found! Useful for making yourself feel better about being up until 5am.
